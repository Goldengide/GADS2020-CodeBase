# GADS2020-CodeBase

In the project directory, I created the follwowing snippets
    * Social media engament time table
        * This table changes its content every 5seconds, it was built to make a social engagement topic time table dynamic such that people engaging your social media content won't figure out that you are using a time-table for your topic
    * Js Alarm challenge
        * The Challenge is quote below
        > The challenge is this: Get four pictures of yourself (I will love it if you get the one where you are eating and coding). Build a clock like the one below, when its 10 am in the morning, show one pic where you are eating and display "breakfast" to the screen. 2pm: another pic and display "lunch". 8pm: another pic and display "dinner". The fourth pic should be displayed if you are not eating. The design is up to you.
        Make sure your page is responsive. Good luck.
